# Requestly Decompressor

## üìå Project Overview

The **Requestly Decompressor** is a tool designed for compressing, decompressing, and processing Requestly session files. This project helps convert compressed session files into easily readable JSON formats, facilitating analysis and further processing.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features

- Compression and decompression of events within Requestly sessions.
- Export sessions to well-structured JSON.
- User-friendly CLI operation and easy integration into existing Node.js projects.
- Configurable with custom-defined source and target directories.
- Optional detailed CLI output (`--verbose`).
- Exclude RRWEB data from exported JSON outputs (`--unset-rrweb`).
- Exclude network activity data from exported JSON outputs (`--unset-network`).

---

## üîß Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (Version 18.x or higher recommended)
- npm (pre-installed with Node.js)

---

## üì¶ Installation

### üîπ Global Installation

Would you like to use the tool globally, system-wide?

```bash
npm install -g @time-to-dev/requestly-decompressor .
```

### üî∏ Direct Usage Without Installation (Using NPX)

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor
```

---

## üìñ Usage

The CLI provides the following options:

### Default Invocation

```bash
requestly-decompressor
```

### NPX Invocation with Default Directories

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor
```

By default, the following directories are used:

- Input directory (`input`): `./source`
- Output directory (`output`): `./output` will be automatically created if it does not exist.

### Custom Source and Destination Directories

If you want to set custom paths:

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor --source ./my-files --output ./my-results
```

### Verbose Mode (Detailed Output)

To get additional details during processing:

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor --verbose
```

---

## üöÄ Integration as a Node.js Module

Use the tool directly within your Node.js code as a module:

```javascript
import { processFiles } from 'requestly-decompressor';

// Default directories (./source as input and ./output as output)
processFiles();

// Or with custom paths and verbose logging:
processFiles('./my-input-folder', './my-output-folder', true);
```

## üìó Explanation of Key Components

### SessionCompressor

Responsible for efficient compression and decompression of events within session files.

### SessionExporter

Handles structured generation and export of session data into JSON format with metadata and events.

### Process Management (`index.js`)

The central workflow for reading, processing, and writing session files.

### CLI Interface (`cli.js`)

A comfortable command line interface (CLI) for easy management and configuration of all available features.
