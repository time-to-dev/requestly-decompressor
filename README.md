# Requestly Decompressor

## üìå Project Overview

The **Requestly Decompressor** is a tool designed for compressing, decompressing, and processing Requestly session files. This project helps convert compressed session files into easily readable JSON formats, facilitating analysis and further processing.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features

- Compression and decompression of events within Requestly sessions.
- Export sessions to well-structured JSON.
- User-friendly CLI operation and easy integration into existing Node.js projects.
- Configurable with custom-defined source and target directories.
- Optional detailed CLI output (`--verbose`).
- Exclude RRWEB data from exported JSON outputs (`--unset-rrweb`).
- Exclude network activity data from exported JSON outputs (`--unset-network`).

---

## üîß Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (Version 18.x or higher recommended)
- npm (pre-installed with Node.js)

---

## üì¶ Installation

### üîπ Global Installation

Would you like to use the tool globally, system-wide?

```bash
npm install -g @time-to-dev/requestly-decompressor .
```

### üî∏ Direct Usage Without Installation (Using NPX)

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor
```

---

## üìñ Usage

The CLI provides the following options:

### Default Invocation

```bash
requestly-decompressor
```

### NPX Invocation with Default Directories

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor
```

By default, the following directories are used:

- Input directory (`input`): `./source`
- Output directory (`output`): `./output` will be automatically created if it does not exist.

### Custom Source and Destination Directories

If you want to set custom paths:

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor --source ./my-files --output ./my-results
```

### Verbose Mode (Detailed Output)

To get additional details during processing:

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor --verbose
```

---

## üöÄ Integration as a Node.js Module

Use the tool directly within your Node.js code as a module:

```javascript
import { processFiles } from 'requestly-decompressor';

// Default directories (./source as input and ./output as output)
processFiles();

// Or with custom paths and verbose logging:
processFiles('./my-input-folder', './my-output-folder', true);
```

## üìó Explanation of Key Components

### SessionCompressor

Responsible for efficient compression and decompression of events within session files.

### SessionExporter

Handles structured generation and export of session data into JSON format with metadata and events.

### Process Management (`index.js`)

The central workflow for reading, processing, and writing session files.

### CLI Interface (`cli.js`)

A comfortable command line interface (CLI) for easy management and configuration of all available features.

## üñ•Ô∏è CLI Options Overview

| Option                    | Description                                                                                                                | Default    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `-s, --source <path>`     | Path to source directory                                                                                                   | `./source` |
| `-o, --output <path>`     | Path to output directory                                                                                                   | `./output` |
| `-v, --verbose`           | Activate detailed output                                                                                                   | `false`    |
| `-r, --unset-rrweb`       | Exclude RRWEB data from the exported JSON file. Use this parameter if you do not need RRWEB recordings in your output.     | `false`    |
| `-n, --unset-network`     | Exclude network data from the exported JSON file. Use this parameter if you do not need network activities in your output. | `false`    |
| `-d, --remove-duplicates` | Remove duplicate entries from the exported JSON file. Use this parameter to ensure unique records in your output.          | `false`    |
| `-p, --prettify-content`  | Format and prettify the exported JSON data                                                                                 | `false`    |

**Example Call**:

```bash
npx requestly-decompressor -s ./input-folder -o ./output-folder -v
```

### üßπ Removing Duplicates (`--remove-duplicates`)

The `--remove-duplicates` parameter provides a way to eliminate redundant network events in the exported JSON files. This feature is particularly useful when you need clean, unique datasets
for your analysis.

#### How It Works:

When activating this option, the decompressor processes all network events and removes duplicates based on an intelligent comparison algorithm:

1. **URL Normalization**: URLs are normalized by sorting query parameters alphabetically. This ensures that URLs that are semantically identical but have different parameter orders are recognized as
   the same.
2. **JSON Normalization**: Request and response data are normalized by comparing JSON objects with alphabetically sorted keys. This ensures that JSON objects with identical content but different key
   order are recognized as duplicates.
3. **Time-Independent Comparison**: To identify true duplicates, time-dependent values (such as `timestamp` and `responseTime`) are ignored during duplicate detection, as identical requests can occur
   at different times.
4. **Complete Content Comparison**: The algorithm not only recognizes identical key structures but also compares all values within the network events. Only when both the structure and all values match
   is an event recognized as a duplicate and removed.

#### When to Use This Option:

- When analyzing browser sessions with recurring API calls
- When cleaning network data for presentations or reports
- To reduce file size and improve processing efficiency
- When identifying clear, unique network activity patterns
